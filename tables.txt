2 Hip and shoulder rotated so that nonthrowing side faces target
3 Steps (weight transferred ) onto foot opposite throwing arm
4 Differentiated trunk rotation (2)
5 Block trunk rotation (1)
6 Timing of release/flight of ball appropriate (late release = downward flight; early release = upward flight)

4 Differentiated trunk rotation (2)
5 Block trunk rotation (1)
6 Arm action/plane of bat movement horizontal
7 Ball contacts bat
8 Swings through ball (action does not stop at ball contact)
Stationary Dribble
1 Arm action independent of trunk
2 Ball contacted with one hand at about belt/waist height
3 Pushes ball with fingertips (does not slap at ball with flat hand)
4 Ball contacts surface in front of or to the outside of foot on preferred side
